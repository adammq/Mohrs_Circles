# Mohrs_Circles
Given a current stress state, calculates principal normal stresses and absolute maximum shear stress; plots corresponding Mohr's circles.
Makes use of the Cauchy stress tensor â€”> eigenvalues correspond to the principal normal stresses; absolute maximum shear stress is then equal to half the difference between the maximum and minimum principal normal stresses.
